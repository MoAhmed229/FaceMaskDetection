# Face Mask Detection using CNN 

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project is built using Python and deep learning libraries, and can be extended for real-time applications.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of dataset with and without mask.
- CNN architecture designed and trained from scratch.
- Accuracy and loss visualization.
- Supports evaluation and prediction on test images.
- Can be integrated with a webcam for live mask detection (future work).
